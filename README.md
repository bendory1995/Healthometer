# Healthometer
Everyone has different health goals. My goal is to gain muscle, lose fat, and maintain the healthy body. I will be logging (and essentially anybody can) daily calorie intake, weight, waist size, gym(yes/no). Over time, it will calculate daily calorie consumption, weight projection, and future targets.
